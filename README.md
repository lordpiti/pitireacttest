# FootballWeb Reloaded React

This is a React app used as a sandbox to consume a REST api and test many of the features in the framework.

Architecture is pretty basic and it's all organised in modules representing each of the areas in the app.

## Some of the functionality the app provides include:
* UI and layout
  * Material UI components
  * Display of graphics using components based on Chart.js
* Store
  * Redux approach using react-redux
  * Middleware using react-thunk
* Practical use of forms and validation
* Use of google maps services
* Authentication
  * Facebook API
  * Google API
* Use of interceptors for HTTP requests to access the API and guards to protect routes in the app
* Real-time web functionality via sockets using the signalR npm package provided by Microsoft
* Use of GraphQL in some areas of the app for client-side database querying using Apollo client
* Available for android and iOS as PWA
